Task 2 : ColorSwitch (NORMAL Mode)

Code which I did for my college club induction: Task 2 : 

Problem Statement:

Bharath has found his speed tester, and has assigned him his work. Bharath now sits free, with plenty of time in his hands. So he intends to play a game to pass his time. Unbeknownst to even his close friends Bharath (aka Mr. Gray) actually loves colors. Help him paint his playroom similar to this so he remains engaged while his junior completes the task.

Normal mode:(Requirements)

 (i)   Create a game where the user presses a button or taps on the screen to make a ball jump.
 
 (ii)  Generate random circular obstacles with at least two colours on each obstacle.
 
 (iii) Touching an obstacle of different colour results in a game over.
 
 (iv)  Calculate score based on distance travelled.
